I did this project as a part of Angela Yu's Web Dev course on Udemy.

The solution files are the way it was solved in the course.

I used the assistance of ChatGPT to complete the project and understand what the code was doing being implementing the code. I also added comments to make it clear what the lines of code were meant to accomplish. My code is probably done a little different than the solution code, but it still accomplishes the main goal and idea of the project. 

If there any ways to make the code more efficient or something I did that doesn't work how it's supposed let me know!
